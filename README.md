# About
Instagram allows you to put between 1-4 pronouns next to your name. This code will generate all possible words from the pronoun combinations. This is a fork from [reidjs](https://github.com/reidjs/)'s [project](https://github.com/reidjs/instagram-pronoun-words), as I wanted to update it to include all the new languages that Instagram added pronoun support for (Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, Indonesian, Turkish, Arabic, Farsi, Norwegian, Finnish, Danish, Dutch, and Swedish). 

The updates to this list allows for a total of 586 words. In comparison, the original list with only English pronouns allowed for 59 different words.

This is also compatible with words in Spanish, including a simplifier that gets rid of any accent character.

## Usage
1. `python pronouns_to_words.py >> output_words.txt`
